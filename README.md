# nix-server
nix-server si project to be able to set up and deploy with git your production server

Final idea
 - have nixos starting image pre-configure / tutorial
 - set up CI/CD for nixos configuration
 - auto setup load balancer to have no down time
 - have 1 server update system
 - have 2 server wait for 1 server and then update as well
 - have many_optimize mod where loadbalancer is not necesary
 - each server should have another app load balancer. 

have a look on nixops if that is any usefull for this.
